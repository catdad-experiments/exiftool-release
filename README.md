# exiftool-release

This repository mirrors the released version of [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).

The original project, along with its released binaries, are [hosted on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/exiftool/). There, the released binaries are regularly deleted, so that only last few versions are available. This makes it difficult -- for me -- to use in my own projects, as I have to constantly update the exiftool dependency, and cannot do so on my own time. Further, SourceForge downloads appear to be a bit flaky, causing a lot of failures in my pipelines. This project is meant to address both of those issues, re-hosting the exact files downloaded from SourceForge as a release on this repository.
